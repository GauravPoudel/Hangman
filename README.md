# Hangman
This is a classic hangman game made in C which also plays sound at certain events like winning a game, exiting a game and losing.
This was initially coded in linux and thats why it has various functions native to linux only.
This program uses SDL2 library to play sounds.
To install SDL2 in linux you may execute the build.sh file present in this repository.
To run the file in windows Download SDL library and configure header, library and linker in the IDE you use

We'll soon also add a file which will work for windows even without SDL.

Any ideas and improvementwill be greatly admired
